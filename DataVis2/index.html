            <h1>Obesity in Australia: Global and Demographic Perspectives</h1>
            <div class="pure-u-1-1">
            <p>Obesity can be assessed in various ways, with the most common method being the Body Mass Index (BMI) scale, 
                which is calculated using a person's height and weight. BMI values help classify individuals as underweight, healthy weight, overweight, or obese.
                For adults, the World Health Organization (WHO) sets the following thresholds: a BMI between 25 and 30 indicates 
                <b>overweight</b> while a BMI over 30 is categorized as <b>obese</b>. However, different BMI cut-off points are applied 
                for specific groups, such as children and pregnant women.</p>
            
                <p>The choropleth map below shows the share of adults who are overweight and obese. One interesting trend is that the share of people who 
                    are overweight tends to be higher in richer countries across Europe, North America and Oceania. Roughly a third of adults in Australia were
                    obese in 2016. In countries such as India and Nigeria, that share was far lower.</p>

                    with 4 in 5 adults (79%) living with overweight or obesity. The Northern Sydney area had the <b>lowest</b> prevalence, with just

                women and <b>71%</b> of men were living with <b>overweight or obesity</b> overweight or obesity. One interestring pattern is
                that obesity is more common in older age groups. In 2022, 15% of men and 16% of women aged 18–24 years were living with obesity, 
                compared with 41% of men and 37% of women aged 65–74. Furthermore, for most measures except men tend to have higher rates than women.</p>

            <h2>Rise of Obesity</h2>
            <p>Obesity rates have been steadily rising worldwide and Australia is no exception. Over the past few decades, the country has witnessed an 
                increase in obesity with around 25% of Australian adults classified as obese as of 2022. </p>
            <p>Recognising the urgency of the situation, the Australia’s National Preventive Health Strategy (NPHS) 
                aims to improve the health and wellbeing of all Australians at all stages of life. Some of the key strategies and initiatives include halting the 
                rise and reverse the trend in the prevalence of obesity in adults by 2030 and to reduce overweight and obesity in children aged 2-17 years by at least
                5% by 2030.  </p>
